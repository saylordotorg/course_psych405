**Unit 1: An Introduction to Personality Psychology** <span
id="1"></span> 
*Personality theories and processes can be defined and conceptualized
according to a variety of factors.  For example, personality theories
and processes differ to the extent of which they address and are
concerned with more fundamental evolutionary components of human
behavior or to the extent of which they address individual difference in
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.  The first readings will help you to
create a working definition of the nature of the research/theories,
which encompass the field of personality psychology.  Next, you will
learn about the science of personality psychology and the various
research methodologies associated with addressing empirical questions in
the field.  Following this section, you will receive a brief overview of
how to read empirical journal articles to prepare you for later
readings.  Finally, you will learn about particular components of
personality including consciousness, perception, and adaptation.    *
