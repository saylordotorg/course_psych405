Personality psychology is the study of the development of personality,
the effects of personality on important outcomes, and attempts to make
beneficial changes to maladaptive personality characteristics.
Personality theories, therefore, differ in how much they focus on
development of personality, change in personality, characterizing
components of personality, and outcomes of personality. The “classic”
theories of personality come from the clinical perspective and, hence,
address human development and change. In contrast, the trait theorists
are less concerned with development and change than in capturing the
characteristics of personality which vary across all individuals. Yet
another alternative focus within personality psychology is on the
intersection of emotions/thoughts/behaviors which work to create the
dynamic expression of personality in various situations. So, what is
personality? Personality can be defined in terms of traits or
characteristics which exist on a continuum and uniquely influences our
cognitions, motivations, and behaviors in various situations across
time. This definition highlights the two major aspects of personality:
first, that personality varies from person to person and second, that
the traits that one person has may be similar to or quite different from
traits that another person has. Consider, for example, the fact that
some people enjoy going out and being around people on a regular basis,
while others may prefer to stay in and do something quiet and relaxing
with their free time. There are clearly subtleties to these traits, with
people rarely staying at the extreme ends of the spectrum. Taken
together, all of an individual’s preferences make up his or her
personality. Given the range of differences that we can see within a
single personality trait, and the range of different personality traits
that one can have, it is easy to see how one’s personality is unique
from any other. This course will begin by explaining and categorizing
the various types of research/theories which constitute personality
psychology. Next, this course will address the science of personality
psychology and the various assessments and research methods used within
this field. After identifying and describing various seminal classical
theories of personality, the trait perspective will be introduced.
Lastly, this course will address the biological/evolutionary
perspectives, and social-cognitive and emotional theories of
personality. Overall, you will gain a sense of the varied nature of
personality psychology. You will also learn to appreciate the unifying
and underlying theme of personality psychology — that of the quest to
determine what drives our behaviors.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:  

-   identify research methodologies involved in the science of
    personality psychology;
-   describe the purpose of comprehensive clinical theories in the field
    of personality psychology;
-   compare and contrast major classical theories of personality (i.e.,
    humanism, psychoanalytic/psychodynamic, behaviorism, cognitive, and
    social-cognitive theories of personality);
-   describe the main concerns of trait theorists, the influential
    figures who helped develop this perspective, and the sequential
    development leading up to the current understanding of traits;
-   define the main components of the five-factor model of personality;
-   identify the theory, methodology, and main findings of the empirical
    journal articles assigned;
-   describe the important contributions of the biological/evolutionary

-   describe the intrapersonal and interpersonal function of emotion as
    an expression of personality.

### Course Information

Welcome to PSYCH405. Below, please find some general information on the
course and its requirements.

**Course Designer**: Helena (Mimi) Martin

**Primary Resources**: This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:

-   Dr. C. George Boeree’s *Personality Theories* from his website
-   University of California, Berkeley: Professor Oliver John’s
    “Personality Psychology” Lecture series
-   The Virtual University of Pakistan’s *Personality Psychology*
-   The Internet Encyclopedia of Personal Construct Psychology:
    Professor Robert Neimeyer’s website
-   Advancing Science Serving Society and the Hastings Center: Catherine
    Baker’s *Behavioral Genetics*
-   Information on Self-Efficacy: Community of Scholar’s website
-   University of California, Berkeley: Dr. Robert Levenson’s
    Psychophysiology’s Lab’s website

**Requirements for Completion**: In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
You will also need to complete a final exam.

In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

**Time Commitment**: This course should take you a total of **103
hours** to complete. Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the
amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These should
help you plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories and to determine how much time you have over the
next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take you 8 hours. Perhaps you can
sit down with your calendar and decide to progress through/complete
subunit 1.1 (a total of 6 hours) on Monday/Tuesday night; subunit 1.2 (a
total of 4 hours) on Wednesday/Thursday night; etc.
