**Unit 2: The Clinical Perspective of Personality Psychology:
Psychodynamic and Humanistic Perspectives** <span id="2"></span> 
*As you have learned from your readings in unit 1, a core project of
personality psychology is to synthesize and test comprehensive and
integrative theories of personality.  Although the recent trend is
towards creating and testing “mini-theories,” the classic voices in
personality psychology have greatly influenced ideas regarding human
development and personality.  These voices took on a clinical
perspective, in that they seek to explain the development of personality
within the context of the individual’s environment and address factors
which contribute to psychopathology.  These next two units will address
four such seminal theories in personality psychology. *  
  
 *In this unit, you will first learn about the purpose and function of
comprehensive clinical theories in the field of personality psychology. 
Next, you will learn how personality is measured on an individual level
from a clinical perspective.  Finally, you will learn about Sigmund
Freud’s personality theory, subsequent influential psychodynamic
theories, and Carl Roger’s Humanistic personality theory.*
