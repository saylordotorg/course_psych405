**Unit 6: Social-Cognitive and Emotional Factors of Personality** <span
id="6"></span> 
*Because our cognitive structures relay important information from our
surroundings and because our personalities can affect this process, our
personalities can affect the ways in which we perceive, interpret, and,
in general, use information.  In turn, cognitive information can impact
how we feel.  As such, personality traits influence both our cognitive
and emotional states.  The next unit will focus on these
social-cognitive and emotional aspects of personality.  Once again, we
will look at another “classical voice” in personality whose theory
focuses on the social nature of learning and personality development. 
After learning about Albert Bandura, the father of social-cognitive
theory of personality and the main tenants of the theory, you will learn
about emotion as it relates to personality.  You will gain knowledge
about the interactions between cognitive and emotional processes which
play a role in the expression of personality.  *
