**Unit 3: Cognitive and Behavioral Theories of Personality** <span
id="3"></span> 
*This next unit will address two different clinical perspectives on
personality.  These perspectives focused less on the influence of
childhood experiences and instead maintained that the root of
personality centers on an individual’s pattern of thoughts and
behaviors.  These theories had a large impact on personality psychology
and have helped to increase our understanding of the expression of
personality.  In this unit, you will first learn about the cognitive
theories of personality as theorized by Albert Ellis.  Second, you will
learn about George Kelly and his theory of personality, which centers on
cognitions.  Lastly, you will learn about B.F. Skinner, a psychologist
who played a seminal role in developing the behaviorist theory of
personality.*
