**Unit 4: The Trait Perspective** <span id="4"></span> 
*In the prior units, you have been exposed to theorists whose main
concern was with the development of personality and therapeutic
approaches aimed at changing maladaptive aspects of personality.  We
will now transition to a different perspective of personality, one that
talks very little of development or personality change and instead
focuses on the identification of traits.  In this unit, you will first
be introduced to trait theory and learn of its historical roots and the
influential theorists who helped develop the trait perspective.  Next,
you will learn about the five-factor model of personality, the most
current and widely accepted trait perspective conceptualization of
personality in psychology.  Finally, you will read empirical articles
which demonstrate the continued scientific efforts to link traits to a
variety of important outcomes.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you 10 hours to complete.

☐    Subunit 4.1: 4 hours

☐    Subunit 4.2: 3 hours

☐    Subunit 4.3: 3 hours

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:

-   Describe the main concerns of trait theorists, the influential
    figures who helped develop this perspective, and the sequential
    development leading up to the current understanding of traits.
-   Define the main components of the five-factor model of personality.
-   Identify the theory, methodology, and main findings of the empirical
    journal articles, which provide applied examples of current research
    on traits.
