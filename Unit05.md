**Unit 5: Evolutionary and Behavioral Genetic Perspectives of
Personality** <span id="5"></span> 
*We will now examine different evolutionary and behavioral genetic
theories of personality.  These theories ask how we can explain the
psychological mechanisms behind what defines “human nature” and the
individual differences found among various traits.  Over the past 20
years, these theories have influenced the field of personality research
via (a) the robust findings that personality traits have a strong
heritable component, and (b) their ability to explain the adaptive
nature of individual differences among personality traits.  *

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you 10 hours to complete.

☐    Subunit 5.1: 2 hours

☐    Subunit 5.2: 4 hours

☐    Subunit 5.3: 4 hours

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   Describe the important contributions of the biological/evolutionary
    perspective made to personality psychology.
-   Identify the main findings in the applied area of research, which
    addresses the effects of biology/environment on such traits as
    impulse control and intelligence.

    Chapter 1 will address the field of behavioral genetics.  Chapter 6
    will address how behavioral genetics helps explain the ability to
    control impulses (a trait-like characteristic).  Chapter 7 will
    address how behavioral genetics helps explain the gene-environment
    interaction that contributes to intelligence, a cognitive ability
    often studied in personality psychology.
